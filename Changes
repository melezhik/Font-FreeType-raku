0.1.7
    - Added $face.forall-glyphs method. Ported from Perl 5
      version 0.0.7.
    - Fixed $glyph.name method on unmapped glyphs.
0.1.6
    Fix t/10metrics_postscript.t to pass on FreeType2 2.9.1+.
0.1.5
    Fix protoypes for FT_Get_First_Char, FT_Get_Next_Char
0.1.4
    - Fix premature destruction of Font-Library
      e.g. this is dangerous:
           my $vera = Font::FreeType.new.face('t/fonts/Vera.ttf');
      The anonymous font library instance could get destroyed also
      destroying the underlying struct for the still-live $vera face.

      Added a $.ft-lib property to face that references
      to library class to avoid it's destruction.

      Also added $.face property to BitMap, CharMap,
      Glyph and GlyphImage to indirectly keep the library
      from being destroyed if any of these sub-objects
      exist.
